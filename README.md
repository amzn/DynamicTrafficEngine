# [Get Started] Dynamic Traffic Engine

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. About Dynamic Traffic Engine

Amazon Ads introduces Dynamic Traffic Engine (DTE), a signal exchange and demand-driven traffic shaping mechanism aimed at reducing programmatic waste and optimizing network and distribution costs for supply-side platforms (SSPs) and Amazon Ads. Amazon Ads shares a set of standard OpenRTB signals, and traffic filtering rules with SSPs. SSPs can then evaluate their bid requests (supply inventory) against those signals, before making a decision to either send or not send the requests to Amazon Ads. DTE helps both SSPs and Amazon Ads better transact on more valuable and in-demand traffic, optimizing Queries Per Second (QPS) bandwidth on both ends.

Dynamic Traffic Engine consists of three major components:

- **DTE cloud:** The DTE cloud component is hosted by Amazon Ads. Amazon Ads uploads low value signal files (currently available in beta) and configuration files to the cloud to provide information regarding signal schema, signal extraction rules and signal output data. The signals are derived from the OpenRTB request that SSPs send to Amazon Ads and are based on Amazon Ads' internal traffic shaping rules and algorithms. High value signal sharing is planned for later in 2026.
- **DTE evaluator library:** DTE evaluator library contains functionality to provide filtering recommendations based on the given signals and traffic filtering rules. The Evaluator library periodically pulls the signals and configuration files from DTE cloud to evaluate each bid request. DTE library vends filtering recommendation for each bid request to the SSP through an API built in the library.
- **DTE filtering**: Once the SSP receives filtering recommendations from DTE evaluator library, SSPs are responsible for enforcing the decision to either filter or forward the bid request on Amazon Ads' behalf.

## 1.2. Manual Overview

This manual provides comprehensive guidance on how SSPs can integrate Dynamic Traffic Engine into their existing systems. The table below provides a high-level view of what is needed to integrate with DTE.

# 2. How to Get Started with Dynamic Traffic Engine

## 2.1. DTE Cloud

Amazon Ads hosts (1) Configuration files, and (2) Signal Output files for SSP consumption in AWS S3 bucket. To set up access to read and download the files from S3, see ***Appendix-1: How to establish connection with DTE cloud.***

**File Data Structure**

*Disclaimer:* Signals will evolve over time. In closed beta, we have low value signal available for sharing to take advantage of QPS optimization benefits. Amazon Ads intends to share high value signals with DTE integrated SSPs in future.

The following data files will be provided in the S3 bucket:

1. Model Configuration file: s3://experiment-traffic-shaping-***aws_region***/***ssp_name***/configuration/model/config.json
    1. s3://experiment-traffic-shaping-us-east-1/test_ssp/configuration/model/config.json
3. Experiment Configuration file: s3://experiment-traffic-shaping-***aws_region***/***ssp_name***/configuration/experiment/config.json
    1. s3://experiment-traffic-shaping-us-east-1/test_ssp/configuration/experiment/config.json
3. Signal Output files: s3://experiment-traffic-shaping-***aws_region***/***ssp_name***/***yyyy***-***mm***-***dd***/***hh***/***model-identifer-name***.csv
    1. s3://experiment-traffic-shaping-us-east-1/test_ssp/2025-01-14/04/adsp_low-value_v1.csv

### 2.1.1. Configuration (or Config) File

There are 2 types of configuration files (1) Model Configuration and (2) Experiment Configuration. Both these configuration files are provided in json format and this section provides information on each of these configuration files. ***Note: Fetching and applying the config files is automatically handled by DTE evaluator library (please refer section 2.2 for how to install the library).***

| # | Configuration Type | Description |
|---|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | ModelConfiguration | This configuration provides information on how the features can be extracted from the OpenRTB request, and transformed into a string that can be matched with the signal output. |
| 2 | ExperimentConfiguration | This configuration provides information on how to split the traffic, such that a portion of the traffic can be allocated for Amazon Ads' learning purpose (referred to as control group) |

#### 2.1.1.1. Model Configuration

This section describes structure of the model configuration json.

| #  | Field | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | type | Type of the configuration. This type of configurations uses *ModelConfiguration* as the type. |
| 2 | modelDefinitionByIdentifier | Defines one or more signals that the DSP shares with the SSP. |
| 2.1 | *[identifier-name]* | Name of the signal. Note that value of this key is different for each signal. |
| 2.1.1 | identifier | Name of the signal. This will be same as the parent key. |
| 2.1.2 | dsp | Name of the DSP that is sharing this signal. Ex: adsp. |
| 2.1.3 | name | Name of the signal. Unlike the "identifier", this field does not have any version information in the value. |
| 2.1.4 | version | Version of the signal. |
| 2.1.5 | modelType | Type of the model, which determines if the tuple outputs identify high or low value supply. One of "HighValue" or "LowValue". "HighValue" models will evaluate requests as low value if no tuple matches, while "LowValue" models will evaluate requests as high value if no tuple matches. |
| 2.1.6 | featureExtractionType | Specifies how the feature extraction is defined. Currently we support only "JsonExtractor", so the json paths are provided in the config to specify how to extract the features from an OpenRTB request in JSON format. |
| 2.1.7 | features | Provides an ordered list of features, and information on how to extract and transform each of those features. |
| 2.1.7.1 | name | Name of the feature |
| 2.1.7.2 | fields | An ordered list of one of more json paths in the OpenRTB request from where the values have to be extracted. |
| 2.1.7.3 | transformation | An ordered list of transformations that must be applied on the values extracted. Currently we have (1) Exists, (2) ConcatenateByPair, (3) GetFirstNonEmpty, (4) IncludeDefaultValue, and (5) ApplyMappings as the named transformations, A reference implementation for each of these transformations is provided in the library. |
| 2.1.7.4 | mapping | *[Optional]* A mapping provided to help with the 'ApplyMappings' transformation. |
| 2.1.7.5 | mappingDefaultValue | *[Optional]* A mapping provided to help with the 'ApplyMappings' transformation. Use this value when the extracted value cannot be mapped using the 'mapping' field. |

#### 2.1.1.2. Experiment Configuration

This section describes structure of the experiment configuration json. The experiment specifies how to split the traffic into 2 or more groups such that one of the traffic group can be used by the DSP to learn about the model performance and train new models for the SSP consumption. *A reference implementation on how to consume the experiment configuration and also split the traffic is provided in the Library.*

| #  | Field | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | type | Type of the configuration. This type of configurations uses *ExperimentConfiguration* as the type. |
| 2 | experimentDefinitionByName | Defines one or more experiments that the DSP shares with the SSP. |
| 2.1 | *[identifier-name]* | Name of the experiment. Note that value of this key is different for each experiment. |
| 2.1.1 | name | Name of the experiment. This will be same as the parent key. |
| 2.1.2 | type | Type of the experiment. Currently only the type "soft-filter" is supported. |
| 2.1.3 | startTimeUTC | Specifies the time on when to start using this experiment. The value is provided as UTC epoch milli-seconds. |
| 2.1.4 | endTimeUTC | Specifies the time on when to stop using this experiment. The value is provided as UTC epoch milli-seconds. |
| 2.1.5 | allocationIdStart | It is used when you use **TreatmentAllocatorOnHash** in the **provideTreatmentAllocator** and provide the request id in the input. Specifies the start and end integers for allocation ids. These allocation ids are split between the treatment groups to inturn split the requests. SSPs are expected to implement (*reference code avalable in library*) logic that randomly assigns an allocationId (integer) to each request that can be evaluated by the model. **It has to be between 0 and 4095 (inclusive).** *We use first 3 chars of the hexdecimal of the request id which is 16^3, as the allocation id.* |
| 2.1.6 | allocationIdEnd |  |
| 2.1.7 | treatments | Provides an ordered list of treatments (traffic groups), and how to allocate traffic between these groups. |
| 2.1.7.1 | treatmentCode | Name of the treatment |
| 2.1.7.2 | idStart | These fields specifies a range of allocationIds. Requests associated with allocation Ids, that fall within this range are associated with this treatment. **It has to be between 0 and 4095 (inclusive).** *We use first 3 chars of the hexdecimal of the request id which is 16^3, as the allocation id.* |
| 2.1.7.3 | idEnd |  |
| 2.1.7.4 | weight | [By Default] It is used when you use **TreatmentAllocatorOnRandom** in the **provideTreatmentAllocator**. Specifies the probability that one request is allocated to one group. |
| 2.1.7.5 | learning | An integer flag to determine if the given treatment (traffic group) is used for learning purposes. Traffic allocated to a learning value of 1 should not be subject to filtering, while traffic allocated to a learning value of 0 is subject to filtering. We still expect SSPs to add extension fields in the bid-requests based on the model filtering evaluation. *See Section 2.2.5* |
| 3 | modelToExperiment | A map of models to experiments, to specify which experiment to use when making filtering decisions for a given model. |
| 3.1 | [model-identifier] | The key in this map is the model identifier defined in the model configuration. *See Section 2.1.1.1* |

*Example:*

```json
{
    "type": "ExperimentConfiguration",
    "experimentDefinitionByName": {
        "DynamicTrafficEngineSoftFilter": {

    }
}
```

### 2.1.2. Signal Output File

This is the raw signal output file. The values for each feature is derived from the OpenRTB request that an SSP sends to Amazon Ads. For current closed beta, any tuple in the output is a low-value tuple and requests matching to any of these tuples are marked to be filtered. ***Note: Fetching Signal Output files are automatically handled by the evaluator library (please refer section 2.2 for how to install the Amazon DTE library or build your own).***

**Example - Low Value Model**

```
// rules are defined by:
// "isMobile|isVideo|publisherId|country|slotSize|slotPosition|deviceType" 
app|banner|537075271|MEX|320x50|a|4
app|banner|537075271|USA|300x250|a|3
app|video|540233827|CAN|640x390|b|7
app|video|540233827|USA|640x390|a|4
app|video|540233831|USA|640x390|b|6
site|banner|537154197|USA|336x280|u|2

site|video|559785277|JPN|640x390|u|2
```

**Example - High Value Deals Model**

```
// rules are defined by:
// "dealId|isVideo|deviceType|country" 
deal123|DISPLAY|DESKTOP|USA
deal123|DISPLAY|MOBILE|USA
deal456|VIDEO|DESKTOP|ALL

```

### 2.1.3. RPMA Threshold Sharing - Monetization Insights

**Important Note**: This data is provided for SSP traffic optimization insights only and is **NOT** used by the DTE evaluator library for filtering recommendation. The DTE evaluator library will only use the the model files specified in Section 2.1.2 for filter/no-filter decisions.

#### 2.1.3.1. Overview

Amazon Ads provides additional monetization model files that give SSPs insights into request performance using RPMA (Revenue Per million Ad Requests) metrics. This data helps SSPs identify their lowest and highest performing traffic patterns and optimize their traffic shaping within QPS allocation caps.

#### 2.1.3.2. File Location

Monetization insight files are available at:

`s3://experiment-traffic-shaping-*aws_region*/*ssp_name*/insights/*yyyy*-*mm*-*dd*/*hh*/monetization_insights_v1.csv`

Example:
`s3://experiment-traffic-shaping-us-east-1/test_ssp/insights/2025-01-14/04/monetization_insights_v1.csv`

#### 2.1.3.3. Data Structure

The file contains incoming requests, impressions and RPMA data for traffic tuples defined by the following dimensions:

| Dimension | oRTB | Description | Mapping |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------|
| delivery_channel | `$.site`, `$.app` | Site or App. "ctv" in delivery_channel is a special case which should be matched "app" blob and "device_type" of 3 (TV). |  |
| format | `$.imp.banner`, `$.imp.video` | Media type like banner or video |  |
| country_code | `$.device.geo.country` | Country code using ISO-3166-1-alpha-3. |  |
| publisher_id | `$.site.publisher.id`, `$.app.publisher.id` | Exchange-specific seller ID. Every ID must map to only a single entity that is paid for inventory transacted via that ID. Corresponds to a seller_id of a seller in the exchange's sellers.json file. |  |
| slot_size | `$.imp[0].video.w`, `imp[0].video.h`, `$.imp[0].banner.w`, `imp[0].banner.h` | Width/height of the video player in device independent pixels (DIPS). Exact width/height in device-independent pixels (DIPS); recommended if no format objects are specified. |  |
| slot_position | `$.imp[0].video.pos` | Ad position on screen |  |
| device_type | `$.device.devicetype` | The general type of device. Refer to [List: Device Types](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/AdCOM/blob/master/AdCOM%20v1.0%20FINAL.md#list--device-types-) in AdCOM 1.0. | 1: MOBILE, 2: DESKTOP, 3: CONNECTEDTV, 4: MOBILE, 5: MOBILE, 6: CONECTEDDEVICE, 7: CONNECTEDTV, 8: UNKNOWN |
| os_name | Derived from `$.device.sua` | Operating system name derived from the user-agent string through WURFL service |  |
| device_make | Derived from `$.device.sua` | Device make derived from the user-agent string through WURFL service |  |
| device_browser | Derived from `$.device.sua` | Device browser derived from the user-agent string through WURFL service |  |
| **Metric** |  |  |  |
| incoming |  | Weekly average incoming bid request count for a given hour |  |
| impressions |  | Weekly average impressions count for a given hour |  |
| rpma |  | Revenue per millions ad requests |  |
| should_filter |  | Filtering decision ("True" or "False") |  |

#### 2.1.3.4. Usage Guidelines

SSPs can use this data to:

1. Identify High-Value Traffic: Focus QPS allocation on tuples with higher RPMA values
2. Optimize Traffic Mix: Prioritize sending requests that match higher-performing patterns over lower-performing patterns
3. Traffic Shaping: Make informed decisions about which traffic to send within QPS caps

#### 2.1.3.5. Example Data Format

```
// tuples are defined by:
// "delivery_channel|format|country_code|publisher_id|slot_size|slot_position|device_type|os_name|device_maker|device_browser|incoming|impressions|rpma|should_filter

ap|banner|USA|pub_12345|320x50|a|4|Android|Samsung|Chrome|5000|1236|22.23|FALSE
site|banner|GBR,pub_67890|728x90|a|2| | |Chrome|10000|755|1.80|TRUE
app|video|CAN|pub_11111|640x390| | | | | |5500|400|4.0| TRUE
```

Important note:

1. The entries that have blanks indicate that all the permutations under that parent have very similar RPMAs and we are consolidated them into a single entry.
2. `ctv` in delivery_channel is a special case which should be matched `app` blob and `device_type` of 3 (TV).

## 2.2. DTE Evaluator Library

DTE evaluator library contains functionality to provide filtering recommendations based on given traffic rules and signals. The Evaluator periodically pulls signals and configuration files from DTE cloud to evaluate SSP bid requests and provide a filtering recommendation to the SSP. The SSP then uses this information to either forward the traffic to Amazon Ads or filter the traffic.

**Important note:**

The evaluator library simplifies DTE integration for SSP:

1. The library evaluates OpenRTB requests against the `Signal Output files` by constructing required tuples for matching.
2. The library reads and applies the `learning percentage` specified in the `Configuration file` to create `treatment` and `control` groups for the experiment.
3. The library automatically syncs every 5 minutes to look for new updates in the `Signal Output files` and `Configuration files` to get most updated filtering recommendation from Amazon Ads. *In beta we refresh the output files every hour.*
4. The DTE evaluator library will only use the the model files specified in Section 2.1.2 for filter/no-filter decisions.

*Will Amazon Ads provide this DTE Evaluator library to SSP or SSP has to build its own?*

Amazon Ads will provide the link to the source code once the SSP has agreed to the below:

1. The SSP has agreed in writing to the additional online terms for code sharing [This will be provided separately via email] and,
2. SSP wants to install and use DTE Evaluator Library provided by Amazon Ads (or will use source code as guideline)

If the SSP decides to build their own version of the evaluator library or custom evaluation logic, we recommend to use the DTE evaluator library source code as guideline and meet specifications and integration requirements in ***Section 3. DTE integration validation requirements.***

### 2.2.1. Pre-requisites

Before starting the integration, ensure you have the following:

1. AWS account with appropriate permissions (refer to Section 2.1)
2. Access to the Amazon Ads AWS S3 bucket (refer to Section 2.1)
3. Use Java Development Kit (JDK) or Golang (unless building your own custom library). The Java library was tested with [Amazon Corretto 17](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/downloads-list.html) and the Golang library was tested with [Go 1.21](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.21).
4. [Java only] For proper logging, `log4j-api` and `log4j-core`, which can be downloaded from [apache-log4j-2.24.3-bin.zip](https://downloads.apache.org/logging/log4j/2.24.3/apache-log4j-2.24.3-bin.zip), must be dependencies in your Java application

### 2.2.2. DTE Evaluator Library Overview

The DTE evaluator library is composed of the following components.

1. ***Evaluator (Online filtering component)***. The SSP service integrates with the library to get recommendations on whether a bid request should be forwarded to Amazon Ads.
2. ***Configuration (Config) Store***. This is the in-memory object that contains information on the signal schema and how to extract features from the incoming OpenRTB request.
3. ***Signal Store***. This is the in-memory object that contains the actual signal output data.
4. ***Signal/Config Refresher***. This component is responsible for connecting to the DTE Cloud and periodically fetch and refresh signals/configs into the in-memory stores.

### 2.2.3. DTE Integration Options

There are several options to integrate with DTE and utilize the shared signals for traffic shaping.

1. Natively integrate the DTE library into the Ad Serving stack with the provided Java or Golang library. The following sections provide additional details on how to initialize the library and evaluate requests.
2. Create a DTE microservice, which is called by the Ad Serving stack. The Java library is recommended for the microservice. Appendix 3 provides a reference Dockerfile for initializing DTE.
3. Custom integration implementation. Refer to section 3 for a complete set of requirements that must be implemented.

### 2.2.4. DTE Evaluator Library Installation

The `BidRequestEvaluatorFactory` class will instantiate all the objects necessary to successfully filter traffic. In the SSP service Spring/Guice config an instance of the `BidRequestEvaluatorFactory` **must be explicitly initialized** after providing all the necessary inputs:

1. ***supplierName***: This is a string that uniquely identifies the SSP within Amazon Ads. The library uses this information to appropriately consume signals and config from the Amazon Ads AWS account.
2. ***credentialsProvider***: This is an object of type `AWSCredentialProvider`, used for connecting to the Amazon Ads AWS account. Amazon Ads hosts signals for SSP consumption in an S3 bucket, and the onboarding process involves setting up access to read and download signal data from this S3 bucket. See *Appendix - 1 How to establish connection with DTE cloud*, for an example on how to configure this credential provider.
3. ***region***: This is a string that identifies the region of the AWS S3 client to be initialized in. In most cases, this will be the AWS region the instance is initialized in.
4. ***bucket***: This is a string that identifies the regionalized S3 bucket (see *Section 2.1*) from which the library fetches all (regionalized) model configuration and output files. In most cases, the bucket will be of the form `experiment-traffic-shaping-*model_aws_region*`, where `*model_aws_region*` is one of: `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`, and `ap-southeast-1`.
5. ***executor*** *(optional)*: The Signal/Config refresher, will look up for new signals/configs in Amazon Ads' AWS account once every 5 minutes. The library can schedule this periodic task on the provided executor. The executor should be an instance of `ScheduledExecutorService`. If this instance is not provided, the factory will instantiate an instance of a `ScheduledExecutorService` internally, as a fallback.

```java
BidRequestEvaluatorFactory bidRequestEvaluatorFactory = 
    BidRequestEvaluatorFactory.create(
        supplierName,
        credentialsProvider,
        region,
        bucket,
        executor);

// initialize background tasks to periodically fetch new signal data to evaluate.
bidRequestEvaluatorFactory.getTaskInitializer().init();

// create an evaluator instance to receive recommendations. 
BidRequestEvaluator bidRequestEvaluator = bidRequestEvaluatorFactory.getEvaluator();

// sleep to ensure initialization is complete before evaluating requests.
Thread.sleep(10000);
```

In addition, update the logging configurations under `src/main/resources/log4j2.xml` as needed.

For the Golang library, the initialization method is slightly different.

1. ***supplier-name***: This is a string that uniquely identifies the SSP within Amazon Ads. The library uses this information to appropriately consume signals and config from the Amazon Ads AWS account.
2. ***credentials***: This is a reference to the AWS Credentials Provider used for connecting to the Amazon Ads AWS account. Amazon Ads hosts signals for SSP consumption in an S3 bucket, and the onboarding process involves setting up access to read and download signal data from this S3 bucket. See *Appendix - 1 How to establish connection with DTE cloud*, for an example on how to configure this credential provider.
3. ***region***: This is a string that identifies the region of the AWS S3 client to be initialized in. In most cases, this will be the AWS region the instance is initialized in.
4. ***folder-prefix/bucket-name***: This is a string of the local path prefix or the bucket prefix where the configuration data and model data is stored. E.g. `local/path/to/metadata` or `s3://experiment-traffic-shaping-us-east-1`.
5. ***schedule-period***: This is an integer that represents the period (in milliseconds) of the scheduled tasks. E.g. a value of 300000 checks for new configuration and model data every 5 minutes.

```go
demanddriventrafficevaluator.NewTaskInitializer(
    supplier-name,
    credentials,
    aws-region,
    folder-prefix/bucket-name,
    schedule-period
).Init()
    
requestEvaluator := demanddriventrafficevaluator.NewRequestEvaluator(
    supplier-name,
    credentials,
    aws-region,
    folder-prefix/bucket-name
)
```

### 2.2.5. Evaluate API

Once the evaluator instance is created, it should be used by the SSP to receive bid or no-bid recommendations. SSP should invoke the `evaluate` method on that instance, before request is forwarded to Amazon Ads. This call will return recommendations, on whether the request should be forwarded to the Amazon Ads.

```java
// API call sample using Java library
BidRequestEvaluatorOutput bidRequestEvaluator.evaluate(BidRequestEvaluatorInput request);
```

For the Golang library, the following method evaluates a given bid request:

```go
requestOutput := requestEvaluator.Evaluate(&evaluation.BidRequestEvaluatorInput{
    OpenRtbRequest: open-rtb-request-string,
    OpenRtbRequestMap: map[string]string
})
```

#### 2.2.5.1. Request Body

| Request Body Field | Type | Description |
|--------------------|------|-------------|
| openRtbRequest | string | Raw OpenRTB request, in JSON format. One of openRtbRequest and openRtbRequestMap must be present. If both are present, openRtbRequest is used. Example: `"{\"cur\":[\"USD\"],\"site\":{\"domain\":\"www.domain.com\",\"publisher\":{\"id\":\"pub123\"},\"id\":\"site123\",\"page\":\"https://www.domain.com/fullurl\"},\"id\":\"request123\",\"imp\":[{\"banner\":{\"pos\":1,\"w\":970,\"h\":250,\"format\":[{\"w\":970,\"h\":250}]},\"bidfloor\":1.23,\"bidfloorcur\":\"USD\",\"id\":\"1\"}],\"user\":{\"id\":\"user123\"},\"device\":{\"geo\":{\"zip\":\"00000\",\"country\":\"USA\",\"city\":\"testcity\"},\"ua\":\"ua_string123\",\"make\":\"desktop\",\"devicetype\":2}}"` |
| openRtbRequestMap | object | Abridged OpenRTB request, as a Map of string -> List<string>. The keys are the path of the field, in [dot notation described in JsonPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started), and the values are a list of string value(s) of the field. One of openRtbRequest and openRtbRequestMap must be present. If both are present, openRtbRequest is used. Example construction: `Map<String, List<String>> openRtbRequestMap = new HashMap<>(); openRtbRequestMap.put("$.app", List.of("testapp")); openRtbRequestMap.put("$.imp[0].video", List.of("testvideo")); openRtbRequestMap.put("$.app.publisher.id", List.of("pub123")); openRtbRequestMap.put("$.device.geo.country", List.of("USA")); openRtbRequestMap.put("$.imp[0].video.w", List.of("123")); openRtbRequestMap.put("$.imp[0].video.h", List.of("456")); openRtbRequestMap.put("$.imp[0].video.pos", List.of("1")); openRtbRequestMap.put("$.device.devicetype", List.of("4")); openRtbRequestMap.put("$.imp[0].pmp.deals[*].id", List.of("deal123", "deal456"));` |

#### 2.2.5.2. Response Body

| Response Body Field | Type | Description |
|--------------------|------|-------------|
| response | Object, required | Filter recommendation for Amazon Ads. |
| **Response Object** |  |  |
| slots (imps) | array of objects, required | Evaluation of signals for each slot (imp object) of the incoming bid request |
| ext | string, required | SSP is expected to add this JSON blob to the `ext` field in the root level object of the OpenRTB request that they forward to Amazon Ads. This field contains information on whether the evaluator internally assigned the request to treatment (*learning*=0) or control (*learning*=1). Example value: `"amazontest": {"learning": 1}` |
| **Slots Object** |  |  |
| filterDecision | float, required | Recommended filter decision for the slot based on Amazon Ads signal(s). This is a value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 indicates no probability of getting response from Amazon Ads, and 1.0 indicates highest probability to get a response from Amazon Ads. |
| reasonCode | string, optional | Future extension to provide more information on how we arrived at the filter recommendation. |
| signals | array of objects, optional | Future extension to provide more detailed information regarding executed signals. |
| ext | string, required | SSP is expected to add this json blob to the `ext` field in the `imp` object of the oRTB request that they forward to Amazon Ads. This field contains information about the decision taken by the evaluator internally. Example value: `"amazontest": {"decision": 0.0}` |
| **Signals Object (future extension)** |  |  |
| name | string | Name of the signal |
| version | int | Version of the signal that was evaluated for this slot |
| status | string | Status of signal execution, one of SUCCESS, ERROR, TIMEOUT |
| debugInfo | string | Debug logs for the signal |

## 2.3. DTE Filtering

Once the SSP receives filtering recommendations from DTE evaluator library, SSPs are responsible for enforcing the decision on behalf of Amazon Ads to either filter or forward the bid request based on the value of `Response.slots[*].filterDecision`. If the `filterDecision` value is 0.0, DTE recommends the SSP filter the request, and if the value is 1.0, DTE recommends the SSP to forward the request.

The SSP will also need to send the following custom extension fields:

1. `slots[*].ext.amazontest.decision`: Recommended filter decision for the slot based on Amazon Ads' signals.
    1. 0.0 = filter slot (low-value request)
    2. 1.0 = forward slot (high-value request)
2. `ext.amazontest.learning`:
    1. 0 if request is in treatment, SSP evaluates request and filter/forward based on filter decision;
    2. 1 if request is in control, SSP evaluates request, but ALWAYS forward the request regardless of filter decision.

These extensions are returned in the DTE Response object under the `Response.ext` and `Response.slots[*].ext` fields and can be appended as-is to the OpenRTB request forwarded to Amazon.

Note that if the request is in control (learning=1), the `Response.slots[*].filterDecision` value will always be 1.0, regardless of the model result. If the request is in treatment (learning=0), the `Response.slots[*].filterDecision` value can be either 0.0 or 1.0, based on the model result.

## 2.4. DTE Failure Handling

When the current hour's model output is not available to be fetched, the DTE library uses the latest successfully loaded model results to evaluate requests for up to 24 hours (the default local cache TTL). After the 24 hour window, all entries in the cache will expire, and no requests will be evaluated as low-value/to be filtered.

In the event that the DTE library evaluation throws an exception, or is unable to properly evaluate the request with the current models, a default fallback response to not filter the request with learning set to 1 (control group) will be provided. In the extraordinary scenario where no response is received, the SSP should assume the default fallback response and forward the request according to their normal flow.

```json
// default BidRequestEvaluatorOutput response for single slot (imp) request
{
    "response":
    {
        "slots":
        [
            {
                "filterDecision": 1.0,
                "ext": "{\"amazontest\":{\"decision\":1.0}}"
            }
        ],
        "ext": "{\"amazontest\":{\"learning\":1}}"
    }
}
```

# 3. DTE Integration Validation Requirements

This integration validation checklist ensures that DTE is correctly implemented and meets all the requirements for filtering traffic on behalf of Amazon Ads. The checklist is applicable whether the SSP decides to install the DTE evaluator library provided by Amazon Ads or builds their own evaluator logic in addition to the filtering logic.

# 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

1. **Are there any types of requests that should not be evaluated by DTE?**
    1. Currently, SSPs should not evaluate requests with Programmatic Guaranteed (PG) deals, Connected TV (CTV) requests, or Native requests. All other requests should be evaluated by DTE.

2. **Will Amazon Ads provide this DTE Evaluator library to SSP or SSP has to build its own?**
    1. Amazon Ads will provide the link to the source code once the SSP has agreed to the below:
        1. The SSP has agreed in writing to the additional online terms for code sharing [This will be provided separately via email] and,
        2. SSP wants to install and use DTE Evaluator Library provided by Amazon Ads (or will use source code as guideline)
    2. If the SSP decides to build their own version of the evaluator library or custom evaluation logic, we recommend to use the DTE evaluator library source code as guideline and meet specifications and integration requirements in ***Section 3. DTE Integration Validation Requirements***

3. **How much memory does the in-memory structures consume?**
    1. This primarily depend on the signal data that is being shared. The signal output file that we are planning to share would consume anywhere between 1 and 10MB. This size also depends on the variability in supply that the SSP can forward to Amazon Ads.

4. **What is the in-memory structure used by Config and Signal stores?**
    1. The library uses Guava Map.

5. **What if I am not on AWS, how do I access DTE cloud for signal sharing?**
    1. If you're not on AWS, you can create an account to create an IAM role. Alternatively, we can provide you with a secured AWS access key for read access to the folders. Use the .NET AWS SDK in your application to interact with the S3 folder. When making requests to the S3 folder, ensure you sign the requests using the SigV4 authorization header. This uses the provided access key to authenticate your requests.

6. **Our back-end tech does not support Java or Golang, how do I install with DTE evaluator library?**
    1. We recommend coding the evaluator library into your language of choice or alternatively, build your own custom evaluator in addition to filtering logic, following all the validation steps outlined in ***section 3***.

7. **What level of involvement is expected from SSPs to onboard DTE?**
    1. If onboarding DTE library (Java/GoLang), we estimate 1 to 2 days for permission setup and additional 1-2 weeks for completing integration with the library, including extension requirements. If building your own custom library, level of effort of approximately 1 month.
    2. We will set up weekly product and engineering sync with email support as needed.
    3. SSP and Amazon Ads should agree on timeline for testing the integration.

8. **What is the latency of the evaluator?**
    1. For the current rules-based model, the latency is <1 ms.

9. **How big are the output files for the current rules-based model?**
    1. The size will depend on the distribution of supply, but we expect the model outputs to be < 1MB.

10. **What are the possible outputs of the evaluator, and what action should SSPs take for each?**
    1. `slots[*].ext.amazontest.decision = 0.0 & ext.amazontest.learning = 0`. Then `slots[*].filterDecision = 0.0`, SSP should filter the slot.
    2. `slots[*].ext.amazontest.decision = 1.0 & ext.amazontest.learning = 0`. Then `slots[*].filterDecision = 1.0`, SSP should **NOT** filter the slot.
    3. `slots[*].ext.amazontest.decision = 0.0 & ext.amazontest.learning = 1`. Then `slots[*].filterDecision = 1.0`, SSP should **NOT** filter the slot.
    4. `slots[*].ext.amazontest.decision = 1.0 & ext.amazontest.learning = 1`. Then `slots[*].filterDecision = 1.0`, SSP should **NOT** filter the slot.

2. Amazon Ads to create a new role in the DTE Cloud AWS Account. Amazon Ads will grant access permissions to specific AWS resources for this role, e.g. `ssp-dte-cloud-access-role`.
3. SSP to create or update the policy statement of their role (ex: ssp-dte-execution-role), to allow assuming the role created in DTE Cloud AWS account.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<DTE-Cloud-AWS-Account-Id>:role/ssp-dte-cloud-access-role"
    }
}
```

4. Amazon Ads to add the following policy statement to trust the role created in SSP's AWS account. This allows the role created in SSP's AWS account to access AWS resources in Amazon Ads AWS account.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<SSP-AWS-Account-Id>:role/ssp-dte-execution-role"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

5. SSP to update their service's Spring/Guice config, to create a credential provider has to first assume their own role (ex: `ssp-dte-execution-role`), and then using that session assume the role provided by Amazon (ex: `ssp-dte-cloud-access-role`). Example below shows how to assume roles:

```java
public StsClient awsSecurityTokenService(
        AwsCredentialsProvider defaultSSPCredentialsProvider) {
    return StsClient.builder()
            .region(Region.US_WEST_2)
            .credentialsProvider(defaultSSPCredentialsProvider)
            .build();
}

public AwsCredentialsProvider stsAssumeRoleCredentialsProvider(
        StsClient stsClient,
        String assumedRoleArn) {
    return StsAssumeRoleCredentialsProvider.builder()
            .stsClient(stsClient)
            .refreshRequest(AssumeRoleRequest.builder()
                    .roleArn(assumedRoleArn)
                    .durationSeconds(3600)
                    .roleSessionName("dte_session_example")
                    .build())
            .build();
}
```

## B. IAM Role Setup for uploading reports [[ref](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/lambda-function-assume-iam-role)]

1. Amazon Ads to create a new role in the DTE Cloud AWS Account. Amazon Ads will grant access permissions to specific AWS resources for this role, e.g. `ssp-dte-cloud-reporting-role`.
2. SSP to create or update the policy statement of their role (ex: `ssp-dte-execution-role`), to allow assuming the role created in DTE Cloud AWS account.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:iam::<DTE-Cloud-AWS-Account-Id>:role/ss-dte-cloud-access-role",
            "arn:aws:iam::<DTE-Cloud-AWS-Account-Id>:role/ssp-dte-cloud-reporting-role"
        ]
    }
}
```

3. Amazon Ads to add the following policy statement to trust the role created in SSP's AWS account. This allows the role created in SSP's AWS account to access AWS resources in Amazon Ads AWS account.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<SSP-AWS-Account-Id>:role/ssp-dte-execution-role"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```

**To upload reports to the S3 folder provided by Amazon**, the SSP has to first assume their own role (ex: `ssp-dte-execution-role`), and then using that session assume the role provided by Amazon for reporting (ex: `ssp-dte-cloud-reporting-role`).

# Appendix-2: Reporting Requirements

Please refer to Appendix-1 [*B. IAM Role Setup for uploading reports*] for how to upload the reports. We will require one csv file per datacenter (US-IAD, US-PDX, EU, FE-SIN) broken out by overall and also individual format (Banner and Video) and delivery channel (Site, App and CTV). Treatment (T) refers to requests with learning value = 0, while Control (C) refers to requests with learning value = 1.

**Example Template**

See the following section (Requested Metrics and Definitions) for the complete set of requests metrics to report.

| Date | Delivery Channel + Format | Total Bid Requests Sent to Amazon | Total Spend ($) | Total Impressions | Bid Request Volume (T) | Bid Request Volume (C) | Requests Filtered by DTE Volume | DTE filter rate (%) | Spend per million ad reqeusts ($) | Fill Rate (%) | Fill Rate (T) | Fill Rate (C) | Spend per million ad reqeusts (T) | Spend per million ad reqeusts (C) | Bid Rate (T) | Bid Rate (C) |

# Appendix-3: Dockerfile Example

For integrating DTE via a microservice, the following Dockerfile, which is used by an integrated partner, can be referenced:

```dockerfile
FROM amazoncorretto:21

WORKDIR /app/supplier-amazon-dte

COPY src/main/docker/run.sh ./
RUN chmod +x ./run.sh

COPY target/lib/ ./lib/
COPY target/supplier-amazon-dte.jar ./

# Port 50051 is being exposed for use by GRPC
EXPOSE 50051
# Port 59220 is being used for health checks
EXPOSE 59220
# Port 9400 is used for Prometheus monitoring
EXPOSE 9400

ENTRYPOINT [ "/app/supplier-amazon-dte/run.sh" ]
```

The `run.sh` executes a Main class, which initializes a DTE instance as described in Section 2.2.4:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
exec java -cp "supplier-amazon-dte.jar:lib/*" com.supplier.amazon.dte.Main
```
